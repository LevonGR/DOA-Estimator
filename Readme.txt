This programm calculates signal AOA using channel state information recorded in a .txt file. Txt file is crated using data acquired during real world experiment where MIMO prototyping system with single MS was used. The data in the file is scaled 1000000 time. 

Programm is open source and compatible with LabVIEW version 15. It could be compatible with newer versions too.
